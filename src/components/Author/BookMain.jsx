                    Amidst The Downpour is a book about the downpour of my thoughts, opinions, and imagination through poetry that represents different themes including self- 
                    love, peace, recovery, morality, individuality, optimism, faith and strength . In 
                    terms of the book cover, with this wind and through this book I’ve let my thoughts 
                    free in the form of poems for others to read and perceive. So these pages flying 
                    with the wind, are my thoughts searching for a reader’s mind as their destination." 

                    The panoramic selection of themes in Arayna’s book — self-love, optimism, faith and morality — are thought-provoking and highly relevant. The book is a great balance of sentiments and individuality. The book comprises beautiful calligraphy titles, bookmark, a thank you letter, and illustrations highlighting the concepts of the poems.
