                <p className='font-quicksand font-[400] text-[18px] mb-8  pl-4'>Keeping in mind the current generationâ€™s love for gaming, this project includes games that spotlight real-world issues through storytelling and allow players to step into the shoes of characters facing real-world challenges related to critical issues such as water scarcity, poverty, lack of access to basic amenities, and the struggles faced by marginalized communities. <br /><br />
                    Not only does it spread awareness but also helps NGOs working towards these causes raise funds by including their donation details at each loss or win with a message. It has successfully helped raise over 60,000 rupees for 4+ NGOs.
